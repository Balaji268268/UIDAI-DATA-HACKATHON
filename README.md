# Aadhaar 360: National Strategic Intelligence Grid
### *From Static Data to Active Governance Intelligence*

**Aadhaar 360** is a decision-support system designed to transform raw Aadhaar transaction logs into actionable policy intelligence. Unlike traditional dashboards that look *backward*, Aadhaar 360 looks *forward*—predicting migration trends, identifying financial exclusion risks, and flagging operational anomalies in real-time.

## 🚀 Key Features (The 4 Pillars)

1.  **🏙️ Migration Pulse**: improving urban planning by tracking high-volume address updates.
2.  **📱 Digital Inclusion Scout**: Identifying districts ripe for FinTech adoption vs. those needing digital literacy camps.
3.  **👶 Ghost Child Indicator**: Detecting districts with dangerously low child enrolment rates (vs. census baselines).
4.  **🛡️ Integrity Shield**: Auto-detecting operational anomalies and potential fraud using Machine Learning (Isolation Forest).

## 🛠️ How to Run

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run Preprocessing**:
    Open `1_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb` and Run All Cells. This will generate the unified CSVs in `processed_data/`.

3.  **Generate Insights**:
    Open `2_Insight_Pillars.ipynb` and Run All Cells. This will produce the visualizations and anomaly lists.

## 📊 Datasets Used
- **Aadhaar Enrolment Dataset**: For age-demographic breakdowns and "Ghost Child" analysis.
- **Aadhaar Demographic Update Dataset**: For tracking address changes (Migration) and mobile links (FinTech).
- **Aadhaar Biometric Update Dataset**: For monitoring mandatory update compliance.
